Description: GStreamer Daemon 
  GStreamer Daemon, also called gstd, is a GStreamer 
  framework for controlling audio and video streaming 
  using TCP connection messages. Qt applications, web 
  interfaces, and GStreamer element test suites show 
  different ways the framework can be utilized. 
  GStreamer Daemon is gst-launch on steroids where you 
  can create a GStreamer pipeline, play, pause, change 
  speed, skip around, and even change element parameter 
  settings all while the pipeline is active.
