GStreamer Daemon, also called gstd, is a GStreamer framework for controlling
audio and video streaming using TCP connection messages. Qt applications, web interfaces,
and GStreamer element test suites show different ways the framework can be
utilized.  GStreamer Daemon is gst-launch on steroids where you can create
a GStreamer pipeline, play, pause, change speed, skip around, and even change
element parameter settings all while the pipeline is active.
