GStreamer Daemon, also called gstd, is a GStreamer framework for
controlling audio and video streaming using TCP connection
messages. Qt applications, web interfaces, and GStreamer element test
suites show different ways the framework can be utilized. GStreamer
Daemon is gst-launch on steroids where you can create a GStreamer
pipeline, play, pause, change speed, skip around, and even change
element parameter settings all while the pipeline is active.

GStreamer Daemon is designed for production deployment, where the
control logic runs in a separate process for the audio video streaming
server. The control application can be written in any language, does
not need to use gobject / glib, as long as data can be exchanged over
a TCP connection. The control application can run on the same
processor (using localhost for the TCP destination) or a separate
machine. Isolating the control logic from the streaming logic solves
many difficult problems, from setting priorities to avoid audio drop
out to having a working user interface if the streaming application
encounters corrupt data. By separating the audio video streaming
logic, it is easy to create automated A/V tests, extend a product's
features to support remote control, and allow the control application
the streaming daemon to be developed independently.
