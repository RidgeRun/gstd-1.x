/**
 * SECTION:gstd_session
 * @short_description: GstdSession Object
 * @title: GstdSession Object
 * @see_also:#GstdObject
 * @include: gstd/gstd.h
 *
 * # Introduction #
 *
 * A #GstdSession encapsulates a GStreamer Daemon session. It holds the
 * structure of pipelines, elements and properties, and provides
 * mechanisms to the user to interact with them. An application may
 * instanciate several #GstdSession objects, and each one will hold a
 * separate list of pipelines. Unless the specific pipelines share
 * physical resources among them, they should operate independently.
 *
 * A #GstdSession is created and deleted as any other GObject:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * #include <gstd/gstd.h>
 * 
 * gchar *name;
 * GstdSession *gstd;
 *
 * gstd = g_object_new (GSTD_TYPE_SESSION, "name", "MySession", "port", 3000, NULL);
 * g_object_get (G_OBJECT(gstd), "name", &name, NULL);
 * g_print ("The session name is \"%s\"", name);
 *
 * g_free (name);
 * g_object_unref (gstd);
 * ]|
 *
 * If the g_object_new() notation yet seems too cryptic, the
 * convenience gstd_session_new() wrapper may be used in a similar
 * way.
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GstdSession *gstd = gstd_session_new ("MySession");
 * ]|
 *
 * # Design #
 *
 * #GstdSession is resource oriented. This means that it exposes its
 * different resources (pipelines, states, elements, properties,
 * etc...) via unique URIs. These resources can be accessed via four
 * generic
 * [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
 * operations (create, read, update and delete) that perform different
 * actions over them, accordingly. These altogether form a minimalist
 * resource server that may easily adapt to different IPCs.
 *
 * The rationale behind this design is to expose a flexible, loosely
 * coupled, extensible interface for the different IPCs controlling
 * the sessions. In fact, many existing IPCs already follow this
 * standard:
 * - In [D-Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus) processes offers their
 * services exposing objects represented by paths similar to the ones in 
 * UNIX file systems. Each object offers methods and signals.
 * - A [ReSTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
 * web service exposes its individual resources using URIs and clients use 
 * HTTP verbs (typically GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE) to interact with them.
 * - [Unix Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) are 
 * mapped to actual paths in the filesystem, allowing clients and servers
 * to access this hierarchical structure to share data.
 *
 * Currently, the structure of a #GstdSession is similar to the following:
 *
 * |[
 *  Session
 *  ├── name
 *  ├── port
 *  ╰── pipelines
 *      ├── count
 *      ├── Pipeline1
 *      │   ├── name
 *      │   ├── state
 *      │   ╰── elements
 *      │       ├── count
 *      │       ├── Element1
 *      │       │   ├── name
 *      │       │   ├── Property1
 *      │       │   ├── Property2
 *      │       │   ├── ...
 *      │       │   ╰── PropertyN
 *      │       ├── Element2
 *      │       ├── ...
 *      │       ╰── ElementN
 *      ├── Pipeline2
 *      ├── ...
 *      ╰── PipelineN
 * ]|
 *
 * - So, the state of Pipeline1 can be accessed via
 * |[
 * /pipelines/Pipeline1/state
 * ]|
 * - The amount of elements in Pipeline2 can be accessed via
 * |[
 * /pipelines/Pipeline2/elements/count
 * ]|
 * - Property1 of Element1 in Pipeline3 can be accessed via
 * |[
 * /pipelines/Pipeline2/elements/Element3/Property1
 * ]|
 *
 * # High Level API #
 *
 * Although it will be typically easier for an IPC to interface with a session 
 * using the low level URI mechanism, a normal human being might not find it
 * intuitive to interact with. For this reason, sitting on top of the URI API,
 * each session exposes a set of high level functions which may seem more natural 
 * and similar to a regular API of other libraries. Each high level function 
 * maps to the URI notation and may be used interchangeably. The following table
 * shows some examples of high level-low level equivalences:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>High Level API</th>
 *     <th>URI Notation</th> 
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>gstd_pipeline_create(name, description)</td>
 *     <td>CREATE /pipelines name description</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>gstd_pipeline_get_state(name)</td>
 *     <td>READ /pipelines/name/state</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>gstd_pipeline_play(name)</td>
 *     <td>UPDATE /pipelines/name/state GSTD_STATE_PLAY</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>gstd_pipeline_delete(name)</td>
 *     <td>DELETE /pipelines/name</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>gstd_element_list(pipe)</td>
 *     <td>READ /pipelines/name/elements</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>gstd_element_set(pipe, name, property, value, ...)</td>
 *     <td>UPDATE /pipelines/pipe/elements/name property value ....</td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 * This API, however, is more coupled to the server and developing a client
 * using them may potentially break the code if the server's architecture 
 * changes in later releases.
